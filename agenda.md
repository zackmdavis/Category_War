In favor of Community, Civilization, and FACTUALLY ACCURATE BELIEFS

It's much _more_ of a constraint in situations that are _known_ to the relevant actors to be adversarial, as with the Gestapo officer at the door.

 [wrote in 2009](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PrXR66hQcaJXsgWsa/not-technically-lying#BYkpXbQF5DjxN9ZsX):

Here is my TODO list—  
✓ Funk-tunul's Legacy and Author's Note  
✓ reply to Scott on free speech
_ top-level review/reply of "Meta-Honesty"
_ reply to Scott on lying  
_ email reply to Vaniver with 9 Blight datapoints  

_ "Instrumental Categories, Wireheading, and War: a Reply to the Immortal Scott Alexander"

the fact that I'm so eager to write other things proves that the memoir is mostly useful as a weapon (and "I need to tell the truth about my life" is my plausibly-deniable excuse for building the weapon)

There is a structure-in-the-world that I don't think you're seeing. I want to call it "algorithmic bad faith."


Here are three blog posts by three different authors pointing at a thing:

 * Benjamin Hoffman's ["Bad Intent Is a Disposition, Not a Feeling"](http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/bad-faith-behavior-not-feeling/)

Strauss vs. Hayek

(A2) writing a long and serious top-level reply to Scott's comment on "Maybe Lying Doesn't Exist"

(A3) cutting down my draft of "Firming Up Not-Lying Around the Edges" as a 2018 Review of  (I was going to cut the psychologizing and cut the Atlas Shrugged example and just say "this is a low standard in most situations because natural language is very ambiguous, but wizard's oath is a much stronger constraint in adversarial situations that are known to be adversarial")

(A4) write a real-name blog post pointing out the similarities and relationship between my October 2016 breakup with the Center-Left Coalition, and my current breakup with the "rationalists"

(B) working on my memoir about why I've been crazier than average this year

(D) reply to Vaniver

An interesting thing about this factorization is that it's agnostic to [where you draw the category boundaries](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/esRZaPXSHgWzyB2NL/where-to-draw-the-boundaries) around ["dishonesty"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bSmgPNS6MTJsunTzS/maybe-lying-doesn-t-exist)! _Dishonesty_ is arguably a morally-laden term: we could imagine two observers who have similar empirical beliefs about a person's psychology, but disagree on whether the person's behavior is best characterized in English as


Actually, maybe I shouldn't be labeling the parent nodes with those words. "Dishonesty" especially is often construed as a morally-laden word, leading to meaningless semantic slapfights 

 "intellectually dishonest" or ["honest but biased"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/16/against-lie-inflation/).

But as aspiring epistemic rationalists, we're _not allowed_ to care about morality, we're _only_ allowed to care about the map that reflects the territory. So maybe I shouldn't be using the word "dishonesty" at all. There are [cognitive inference algorithms](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HcCpvYLoSFP4iAqSz/rationality-appreciating-cognitive-algorithms) that build world-models and output speech that other people can use as evidence/input to their own inference algorithms.

Some algorithms are better than others at constructing models that make good predictions.

Some are better than others at outputting speech that
