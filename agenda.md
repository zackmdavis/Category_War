_ Algorithmic Bad Faith


A Coordination Argument for Candor




"Can I give you a cookie to not title it that?"

I would have expected you to care about your students



In favor of Community, Civilization, and FACTUALLY ACCURATE BELIEFS

It's much _more_ of a constraint in situations that are _known_ to the relevant actors to be adversarial, as with the Gestapo officer at the door.

In a discussion on 


 [wrote in 2009](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PrXR66hQcaJXsgWsa/not-technically-lying#BYkpXbQF5DjxN9ZsX):

Here is my TODO list—  
✓ Funk-tunul's Legacy and Author's Note  
✓ reply to Scott on free speech
_ top-level review/reply of "Meta-Honesty"
_ reply to Scott on lying  
_ email reply to Vaniver with 9 Blight datapoints  

_ "Instrumental Categories, Wireheading, and War: a Reply to the Immortal Scott Alexander"  
_ email explain scapegoating to Anna

_ a world where reason doesn't exist: https://twitter.com/zackmdavis/status/1203017876405284865

_ Firming Up Not-Lying

_ work on memoir  

also—
_ email: The Coalition-Splitting Maneuver, and Unilateralism  
_ email: Strauss vs. Hayek, quantitatively  
_ tell Wei about Timur Kuran's definition of an "activist"  
_ Less Wrong Poetry Corner: My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic's "A Kirin Tale"  
_ Gary Drescher fan mail  

the fact that I'm so eager to write other things proves that the memoir is mostly useful as a weapon (and "I need to tell the truth about my life" is my plausibly-deniable excuse for building the weapon)

_ Less Wrong Poetry Corner: Walter Raleigh's "The Lie" 

_ "Don't Tell Me Secrets"  

_ Two Moralities: Accomplishing Things Subject to Constraint of Not-Lying (and feeling terrible when you slip up and lie) vs. Clarity-Creation Subject to the Constraint of Respecting Confidentiality (and feeling terrible when you slip up and reveal information)

Promises 

There is a structure-in-the-world that I don't think you're seeing. I want to call it "algorithmic bad faith."


Here are three blog posts by three different authors pointing at the thing (listed in order of the [Sliding Scale](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfTropes) of Moralizing _vs._ Math):

 * Ziz's ["False Faces"](https://sinceriously.fyi/false-faces/)
 * Ben Hoffman's ["Bad Intent Is a Disposition, Not a Feeling"](http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/bad-faith-behavior-not-feeling/)
 * the present author's ["Algorithms of Deception!"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fmA2GJwZzYtkrAKYJ/algorithms-of-deception)

Strauss vs. Hayek

(A2) writing a long and serious top-level reply to Scott's comment on "Maybe Lying Doesn't Exist"

(A3) cutting down my draft of "Firming Up Not-Lying Around the Edges" as a 2018 Review of  (I was going to cut the psychologizing and cut the Atlas Shrugged example and just say "this is a low standard in most situations because natural language is very ambiguous, but wizard's oath is a much stronger constraint in adversarial situations that are known to be adversarial")

(A4) write a real-name blog post pointing out the similarities and relationship between my October 2016 breakup with the Center-Left Coalition, and my current breakup with the "rationalists"

(B) working on my memoir about why I've been crazier than average this year

(D) reply to Vaniver
