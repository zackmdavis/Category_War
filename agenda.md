Promises 

There is a structure-in-the-world that I don't think you're seeing. I want to call it "algorithmic bad faith." Here are three blog posts by three different authors pointing at the thing (listed in order of the [Sliding Scale](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfTropes) of Moralizing _vs._ Math):

 * Ziz's[^ziz] ["False Faces"](https://sinceriously.fyi/false-faces/)
 * Ben Hoffman's ["Bad Intent Is a Disposition, Not a Feeling"](http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/bad-faith-behavior-not-feeling/)
 * the present author's ["Algorithms of Deception!"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fmA2GJwZzYtkrAKYJ/algorithms-of-deception)

Theory of Universal Algorithmic Bad Faith

my forthcoming memoir (working title: "['I Tell Myself to Let the Story End'](https://genius.com/Sara-bareilles-gonna-get-over-you-lyrics); [Or](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EitherOrTitle), [A Hill of Validity in Defense of Meaning](https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1067185907843756032); Or, The Story About That Time Everyone I [Used to Trust](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wustx45CPL5rZenuo/no-safe-defense-not-even-science) Insisted on Playing Dumb About the Philosophy of Language in a Way That Was Optimized for Confusing Me Into [Cutting My Dick Off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginoplasty) (Independently of the Empirical Facts Determining Whether or Not Cutting My Dick Off Is a Good Idea) and Wouldn't Even Cut It Out Even After I Spent Five Months and Thousands of Words Trying to Explain the Mistake in Exhaustive Detail Including Dozens of Links to Their Own Writing; Or, We Had [an Entire Sequence About This](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FaJaCgqBKphrDzDSj/37-ways-that-words-can-be-wrong), You Lying Motherfuckers")

Strauss vs. Hayek

(A2) writing a long and serious top-level reply to Scott's comment on "Maybe Lying Doesn't Exist"

(A3) cutting down my draft of "Firming Up Not-Lying Around the Edges" as a 2018 Review of  (I was going to cut the psychologizing and cut the Atlas Shrugged example and just say "this is a low standard in most situations because natural language is very ambiguous, but wizard's oath is a much stronger constraint in adversarial situations that are known to be adversarial")

(A4) write a real-name blog post pointing out the similarities and relationship between my October 2016 breakup with the Center-Left Coalition, and my current breakup with the "rationalists"

(B) working on my memoir about why I've been crazier than average this year

(D) reply to Vaniver
