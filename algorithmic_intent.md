## Algorithmic Intent: A Hansonian Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle

It's tempting to think that consciousness isn't part of the physical universe. Seemingly, we can imagine a world _physically_ identically to our own—the same atom-configurations evolving under the same laws of physics—but with no _consciousness_, a world inhabited by [philosophical "zombies"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fdEWWr8St59bXLbQr/zombies-zombies) who move and talk, but only as mere automatons, without the spark of _mind_ within.

It can't actually work that way. When we _talk_ about consciousness, we do so with our merely physical lips or merely physical keyboards. The causal explanation for talk about consciousness has to _either_ exist entirely within physics, _or_ there needs to be some place where the laws of physics are violated as the immaterial soul is observed to be "tugging" on the brain. Zombies can't exist.

But if consciousness exists within physics, it should respect a certain ["locality"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XDkeuJTFjM9Y2x6v6/which-basis-is-more-fundamental), a [Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kYAuNJX2ecH2uFqZ9/the-generalized-anti-zombie-principle): if the configuration-of-matter that is you is conscious, then _almost_-identical configurations should also be conscious for _almost_ the same reasons. An artificial neuron that implements the same input-output relationships as a biological one, would "play the same role" within the brain.

"The bureaucrat, police officer, teacher, judge, or cable television company representative functions as [...], not as a co-modeling and fully interacting person. His behaviors are governed by top-down rules and scripts, with human discretion eliminated as much as possible."
