Outline of this sectionâ€”
* it's not that we've siezed on phylogenetics as "the" thing to draw definitions around, it's that phylogeyny actually has things to say about which things are all-around similar to each other
* paraphyly makes sense if the excluded clades picked up salient features, that the rest of the clade didn't
* if you had an unlabeled tree, you wouldn't know where to cut it, and you wouldn't be inspired to make up paraphyletic groups up, without a particular reasonâ€”but we do have a reason
* this is especially true if we're interested in present-day animals
* the historical case for dolphins are fish is false-to-fact: Fledermaus, Aristotle, penguins
* dark skinned Indians aren'te black
* You know what else are paraphyletic?
* polyphyletic is even worseâ€”actually a disconnected set on phylogenetic space, not just not-monophyletic




Okay, here's my analysis of the dolphin problem. Sorry again for flipping out the other month. ðŸ˜° But, separately from me being mean and crazy, on the object level, there's absolutely no excuse for not getting this right! Aristotle got this right; why can't MIRI?!

If there are no counterarguments, can I get a retweet here to correct the earlier disinfo? Separately from me being a bad & unstable person who shouldn't have flipped out like that, on the object-level, there's no excuse for not getting this right!! 2/2

interpretability might help with RSI!!! That settles it, I'm going into biology

> the phylogenist's definition ("mammals are chordata tho, which is what you should mean when you say 'fish'.").

This is a goddamned strawman. _Chordata_? Chordates?
