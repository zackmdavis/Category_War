_Without denying the obvious similarities that motivated the initial categorization `{salmon, guppies, sharks, dolphins, trout, ...}`, there is_ more structure _in the world: to maximize the probability your world-model assigns to your observations of dolphins, you need to take into consideration the many aspects of reality in which the grouping `{monkeys, squirrels, dolphins, horses ...}` makes more sense._

_The old category might have been "good enough" for the purposes of the sailors of yore, but as humanity has learned more, as our model of Thingspace has expanded with more dimensions and more details, we can see the ways in which the original map failed to carve reality at the joints ..._

So the one comes to you—again—and says:

> Hold on. _In what sense_ did the original map fail to carve reality at the joints? You don't deny the obvious similarities between dolphins and fish—between dolphins and _other_ fish. That's a [cluster in configuration space](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBw8dDkAWohFjWQSk/the-cluster-structure-of-thingspace)! The observation that dolphins are evolutionarily related to mammals may be an interesting fact that specialized professional evolutionary biologists care about for some inscrutible specialist reason. But _I'm_ not a professional evolutionary biologist. Choosing to define categories around evolutionary relatedness rather than macroscopic human-relevant features seems like an arbitrary æsthetic choice. Why should I care about phylogenetics _at all_?

Focusing on evolutionary relatedness is not an arbitrary æsthetic choice because evolution _actually happened_. Evolution isn't just a story that our Society's specialists happen to have chosen on an arbitrary æsthetic whim; they chose it [_because it predicts what we see in the world_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution). You _can't_ choose a substantively different theory and make the same predictions about the real world. (At most, you'd end up with an isomorphic theory with epiphenominal elements, asserting that an allele rose in frequency ["because" the angels willed it](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WqGCaRhib42dhKWRL/if-many-worlds-had-come-first), without an account of why the angels' will happens to line up with what would have transpired if there were no angels.)

Similarly, category definitions [represent hidden probabilistic inferences](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3nxs2WYDGzJbzcLMp/words-as-hidden-inferences); [you _can't_ choose different categories and make the same predictions about the real world](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/onwgTH6n8wxRSo2BJ/unnatural-categories-are-optimized-for-deception).

Accordingly, it shouldn't be surprising that our knowledge of evolution turns out to have implications for how we should categorize organisms—not as an æsthetic choice, but for deep structural _reasons_ that can be understood mechanistically.

One element of the evolutionary worldview is a "continuity" assumption: all else being equal, creatures that are more closely related are more similar _in general_. Creationists sometimes try to discredit evolution by ridiculing the absurdity of a monkey giving birth to a person. But actually, evolutionary biologists [_agree_ on the absurdity of that specific example](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4Bwr6s9dofvqPWakn/science-as-attire). Monkeys _don't_ suddenly give birth to humans in a single generation! If they did, that would _utterly falsify_ our understanding of evolution! Rather, present-day monkeys and present-day humans had a common ancestor

In [the formalization of causality in terms of directed acyclic graphs](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hzuSDMx7pd2uxFc5w/causal-diagrams-and-causal-models) [pioneered by Judea Pearl and others](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jnjjzkH8Fdzg4D6EK/causality-a-chapter-by-chapter-review), an organism's genome is at the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooted_graph) of the causal graph underlying all other features of an organism.

OUTLINE—

* Objection: you agree that the convergently-evolved similarities _exist_; in what sense is dolphins-are-fish _wrong_? Why should I care about phylogenetics, at all?
* Reply: Definitions are just a pointer to help you find the cluster, root of the causal graph, conditional independence
* Objection: But, but, if you are using phylogenetics as your criterion, why paraphyly?
* Reply: We at least want a connected set on phylogenetic space, but we're not just looking at an unlabeled tree; it makes sense to split off groups that diverged, many examples, bats, penguins; we expect fish/mammal/reptile/bird to be mutually exclusive
* dark skinned Indians aren'te black
* Objection: but then shouldn't we pick different words for the convergent and phylo clusters? Uncomfortable with wavering lines around "berry"
* Reply: story for how we end up with multiple senses attached to the same word


I don't personally notice the difference between alligators and crocodiles, but precisely because I don't need to care, you don't see me demanding a hypernym

As part of [a review of a book on post-traumatic stress disorder](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/12/book-review-the-body-keeps-the-score/), psychiatrist Scott Alexander casually mentions the American Psychiatric Association's "philosophical commitment to categorizing by symptoms rather than cause": "[w]hen the APA decides not to [recognize developmental trauma disorder], they're not necessarily rejecting the seriousness of child abuse, only saying it's not the kind of thing they build their categories around."

In a sane world, this would be _utterly discrediting_ to the APA. The cognitive function of categories is to group relevantly similar things together in order to make similar predictions and decisions about them. But in order to treat a condition, causes are of supreme relevance! Medical doctors understand this: we consider bacterial and viral infections to be different categories of disease even when they cause similar symptoms, because antibiotics can treat the former but not the latter. No matter what words are used to describe it, at some point your decision algorithm _needs_ to categorize by cause _in order to compute the correct treatment_. If the authoritative body of professional psychiatrists has a "philosophical committment" against this, that means _we don't have a science of psychiatry_.

Why dolphins aren't fish. (Thanks to @So8res for inspiration and @ESYudkowsky for the theory.) Please reTweet to counter popular disinformation on this question!

I'm sorry I flipped out earlier (that was Actually Bad), but when I see disinformation about the laws of reasoning themselves spreading in the so-called "rationalist" community, I take that extremely seriously!!
