## Unlike Perception, Communication Requires Common Interest or Costly Signals

In order for information to be transmitted from one place to another, it needs to be conveyed by some physical medium: [material links of cause and effect that vary in response to variation at the source](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6s3xABaXKPdFwA3FS/what-is-evidence), correlating the states of different parts of the universe—a "map" that reflects a "territory." When you see a rock, that's only possible because the pattern of light reflected from the rock into your eyes is different from what it would have been if the rock were a different color, or if it weren't there.

This is the rudimentary cognitive technology of _perception_. Notably, perception only requires technology to be present on the receiving end.

Your brain and your eyes were optimized to interpret light as conveying information from elsewhere in the universe. The rock wasn't: 

In contrast, the advanced cognitive technology of _communication_ is more capital-intensive: 

 "communication" 


[REMAINING OUTLINE
* For info inside an agent's brain, you need a convention, but that requires common interest to evolve
* Alternatively, costly signaling also solves the problem
* You need one of those!! That's why Robin Hanson worldview in which signaling is ubiquitous should be less counterintuitive—otherwise, communication would be impossible!
* We can interpret birdsong because the birds aren't singing to us, we're not part of the game
