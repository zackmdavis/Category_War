# Comment on "Endogenous Epistemic Factionalization"

Why do beliefs cluster? Some say ideology, but the clusters we see don't seem coherent enough for that

Polarization: stable beliefs despite discussion—disagreement isn't polarization because it's not stable

models of cultural influence assume there is no fact of the matter; you can't share evidence for liking Mozart

N agents choose between A and B, which each give the same payoff on success, but have a different probability of success. pA = 0.5, pB = 0.5 +/- ε

B is actually better; agents' credence that B is better are drawn from a uniform distribution

in each round, each agent does what they think is best n times, and does a Bayesian update on the result (A is already well understood)

update on neighbors—complete network

in the model as described, we get consensus
