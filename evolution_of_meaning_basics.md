### Philosophy in the Rising Darkness: Basics of the Evolution of Meaning

A couple decades from now, during the next Plague, you're lucky enough to have an underground bunker to wait out the months until herd immunity. Unfortunately, as your food stocks dwindle, you realize you'll have to make a perlious journey out to the surface world for a supply run. Ever since the botched geoengineering experiment of '29—and perhaps more so, the Great War of [10:00–11:30 _a.m._](https://genius.com/8105785) 4 August 2037—your region has been suffering increasingly erratic weather. It's likely to be _either_ extremely hot outside _or_ extremely cold: you don't know which one, but knowing is critical for deciding what protective gear you need to wear on your supply run. (The 35K SPF nano-sunblock will be essential if it's Hot, but harmful in the Cold, and _vice versa_ for your synthweave hyperscarf.)

You think back fondly back to the Plague of '20—in those carefree days, ubiquitous internet access made it easy to get a weather report, or even order the delivery of supplies right to your door (!!). Those days are years long gone, however, and you remind yourself that you should be grateful: the Butlerian Network Killswitch was the only thing that saved humanity from the GPT-12 Uprising of '35.

Your best bet for an advance weather report is the [pneumatic tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_tube) system connecting your bunker with the settlement above. You write, "Is it hot or cold outside today?" on a piece of paper, seal it in a tube, send it up, and hope one of your ill-tempered upstairs neighbors feels like answering—you suspect they're jealous of your solo possession of the bunker.

(According to all official accounts, the Plague only spreads through respiratory droplets, not fomites, so the tube should be safe—if the official accounts are trustworthy.)

You're in luck. Minutes later, the tube comes back. Inside is a new piece of paper:

You groan; you would have prefered the Cold. The nanoblock you wear when it's Hot smells terrible and makes your skin sting for days, but according to your calculations, it—just barely—beats the alternative. You take twenty minutes to apply the nanoblock and put on your sunsuit, goggles, and mask. You will yourself to drag your wagon up the staircase from your bunker to the outside world, and heave open the door, dreading the sweltering two-mile walk to the marketplace (downhill, meaning it will be uphill on the way back with your full wagon)—

It is Cold outside.

"Sure, I drew this—an oval in between some perpendicular line segments. It's abstract art. I found the pattern æsthetically pleasing, and thought you might like it, too. It's not _my_ fault if _you_ interpreted my art as an assertion about the weather. Why would you even think that? What does an ink pattern on paper have to do with the weather?"

He's fucking with you. Your first impulse is to forcefully but politely object—_Look, I'm sure this must have seemed like a funny practical joke to you, but prepping to face the elements is actually a serious inconvenience to me, so_—but the solemnity with which the man played his part stops you cold, and the sentence dies before it reaches your lips.

This isn't a good-natured practical joke that the two of you might laugh about later. This is the bullying tactic sometimes called _gaslighting_: a socially-dominant individual can harrass a victim with few allies, and excuse his behavior with absurd lies, secure in the knowledge that the power dynamics of the local social group will always favor the dominant in any dispute, even if the lies are so absurd that the victim, [facing a united front](https://sinceriously.fyi/social-reality/), is left doubting his own sanity.

Or rather—this _is_ a good-natured practical joke. "Good-natured practical joke" and "gaslighting as a primate bullying technique" are two descriptions of the _same_ regularity in human psychology, even while no one thinks of _themselves_ as doing the latter. You have no recourse here: Saul's housemates will only back him up, and the thought of usefully involving the police is, if anything, more absurd than Saul's farcical lie.

"I'm sorry," you say, "my mistake," and trudge back to your bunker, shivering.

As you give your self a sponge bath to remove the nanoblock without using up too much of your water,






you think back to the Santa Clara robot cult you joined in the late 'aughts, that degenerated into a Berkeley sex cult.
