# Firming Up Not-Lying Around Its Edge-Cases Is Surprisingly Useless

**Reply to**: [Meta-Honesty: Firming Up Honesty Around Its Edge-Cases](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xdwbX9pFEr7Pomaxv/meta-honesty-firming-up-honesty-around-its-edge-cases)

Eliezer Yudkowsky, listing advantages of a "wizard's oath" ethical code of "Don't say things that are literally false", writes—

> Most people, even most unusually honest people, wander about their lives in a fog of internal distortions of reality. Repeatedly asking yourself of every sentence you say aloud to another person, "Is this statement actually and literally true?", helps you build a skill for navigating out of your internal smog of not-quite-truths. For that is our mastery.

I mean, that's _one_ hypothesis about the psychological effects of adopting the wizard's code.

A potential problem is that human natural language contains a _lot_ of ambiguity. Words can be used in many ways depending on context. Even the specification "literally" in "literally false" is less useful than it initially appears when you consider that the way people _ordinarily_ speak when they have [intent to inform](http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/honesty-and-perjury/#Intent_to_inform) is actually pretty dense with metaphors that we typically don't _notice_ as metaphors because they're common enough to be recognized legitimate uses that all fluent speakers will understand.

For example, if I want to convey the meaning that our study group has covered a lot of material in today's session, and I say, "Look how far we've come today!" it would be _pretty weird_ if you were to object, "_Liar!_ We've been in this room the whole time and haven't physically moved at all!" because in this case, it really is obvious to all ordinary English speakers that that's not what I meant by "how far we've come."

Other times, the "intended"[^intended] interpretation of a statement is not only not obvious, but speakers can even mislead by motivatedly equivocating between different definitions of words: the immortal Scott Alexander has written a lot about this phenomenon under the labels ["motte-and-bailey doctrine"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/) (as [coined by Nicholas Shackel](https://philpapers.org/archive/SHATVO-2.pdf)) and ["the noncentral fallacy"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yCWPkLi8wJvewPbEp/the-noncentral-fallacy-the-worst-argument-in-the-world).

[^intended]: I'm scare-quoting "intended" because this process isn't necessarily conscious, and probably usually isn't. Internal distortions of reality in [imperfectly deceptive social organisms](https://intelligence.org/files/CFAI.pdf#page=48) can be [adaptive for the function of deceiving conspecifics](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DSnamjnW7Ad8vEEKd/trivers-on-self-deception).

So the question "Is this statement actually and literally true?" is itself potentially ambiguous. It could mean either—

 * "Is this statement actually and literally true _as the audience will interpet it?_"; or,
 * "Does this statement _permit an interpretation under which_ it is actually and literally true?"

But while the former is complicated and hard to establish, the latter is ... _really just not that strict of a constraint_.

Think about it. When's the last time you needed to consciously tell a bald-faced, _unambiguous_ lie?—something that could realistically be _outright proven false_ in front of your peers, rather than dismissed with a "reasonable" amount of language-lawyering. (Whether "Fine" is a lie in response to "How are you?" depends on exactly what "Fine" is understood to mean in this context. ["Being acceptable, adequate, passable, or satisfactory"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fine#Adjective)—to what standard?)

Maybe I'm _unusually_ honest—or possibly unusually bad at remembering when I've lied!?—but I'm not sure I even _remember_ the last time I told an outright unambiguous lie. The situation just _doesn't come up that often_.

Now ask yourself how often your speech has been partially optimized for any function _other_ than providing listeners with information that will help them [better anticipate their experiences](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences). The answer is, "Nearly every time you open your mouth"[^mouth]—and if you disagree, then you're lying. (Even if you only say true things, you're more likely to pick true things that make you look good, rather than your most embarrassing secrets. That's [optimization](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7EcMhL26zFNbJ3ED/optimization).)

[^mouth]: Actually, that's not literally true! You often open your mouth to breathe or eat without saying anything at all! Is the referent of this footnote then a blatant lie on my part?—or can I expect you to _know what I meant_?

In the study of AI alignment, it's a truism that

So _another_ hypothesis is that, in the face of sufficiently strong incentives to deceive, the wizard's oath just ends up with you training yourself to get _really good_ at misleading people with a variety of [not-technically-lying](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PrXR66hQcaJXsgWsa/not-technically-lying) rhetorical tactics (motte-and-baileys, false [implicatures](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/), [stonewalling](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wqmmv6NraYv4Xoeyj/conversation-halters), [selective reporting](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/esRZaPXSHgWzyB2NL/where-to-draw-the-boundaries), [clever rationalized arguments](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9f5EXt8KNNxTAihtZ/a-rational-argument), [gerrymandered category boundaries](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/esRZaPXSHgWzyB2NL/where-to-draw-the-boundaries), _&c._), all the while congratulating yourself on how "honest" you are for not making "literally" "false" individual statements.

In Ayn Rand's novel _Atlas Shrugged_, [...]

> "The State Science Institute," he said quietly, when they were alone in her office, "has issued a statement warning people against the use of Rearden Metal." He added, "It was on the radio. It's in the afternoon papers."
>
> "What did they say?"
>
> "Dagny, they didn't say it! ... They haven't really said it, yet it's there—and it—isn't. That's what's monstrous about it."
>
> [...] He pointed to the newspaper he had left on her desk. "They haven't said that Rearden Metal is bad. They haven't said it's unsafe. What they've done is ..." His hands spread and dropped in a gesture of futility.
>
> She saw at a glance what they had done. She saw the sentences: "It may be possible that after a period of heavy usage, a sudden fissure may appear, though the length of this period cannot be predicted. ... The possibility of a molecular reaction, at present unknown, cannot be entirely discounted. ... Although the tensile strength of the metal is obviously demonstrable, certain questions in regard to its behavior under unusual stress are not to be ruled out. ... Although there is no evidence to support the contention that the use of the metal should be prohibited, a further study of its properties would be of value."

> "We can't fight it. It can't be answered," Eddie was saying slowly. "We can't demand a retraction. We can't show them our tests or prove anything. They've said nothing. They haven't said a thing that could be refuted and embarrass them professionally. It's the job of a coward. You'd expect it from some con-man or blackmailer. But, Dagny! It's the State Science Institute!"

I think Eddie is right to feel horrified and betrayed here. At the same time, with respect to wizard's code, _no lying has taken place_.

I like to imagine the statement having been drafted by an idealistic young scientist in Dr. Floyd Ferris's office at the State Science Institute. Our scientist knows that Dr. Ferris expects a statement that will make Rearden Metal look bad.

"It may be possible after a period of heavy usage, a sudden fissure may appear." Is this statement actually and literally true? _Yes!_ It _may be possible!_ 

"The possibility of a molecular reaction, at present unknown, cannot be entirely discounted." Is this statement actually and literally true? _Yes!_ The _possibility_ of a molecular reaction, at present unknown, _cannot be entirely discounted_.

"Although the tensile strength of the metal is obviously demonstrable, certain questions in regard to its behavior under unusual stress are not to be ruled out." Is this statement actually and literally true? _Yes!_ The lab tests did in fact demonstrate the metal's unprecedented tensile strength. But certain questions in regard to its behavior under unusual stress are _not to be ruled out_.

Well… we have no idea who did it… no particular evidence singling out any of the million people in this city… but let’s consider the hypothesis that this murder was committed by Mortimer Q. Snodgrass, who lives at 128 Ordinary Ln. It could have been him, after all.”

Exotic scenarios of when outright-lies are acceptable doesn't help _at all_

_intellectual_ honesty, which is ubiquitous.



I don't _know_ how to unravel the web of deceit, misinformation, fake news, gaslighting, and fraud that threatens to consume us all. But one thing I'm pretty sure _won't_ help is _clever logic puzzles about hypothetical Nazis_.
