## How to unwind one's "rationalist" social identity?

**Background reading:** [The Ideology Is Not the Movement](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement/), [The Craft Is not the Community](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/08/08/the-craft-is-not-the-community/), [What Is Rationalist Berkeley's Community Culture?](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/), my maybe-forthcoming memoir that I can't summon the energy to finish because it's too emotionally painful

So, we have this word "rationalist", that's overloaded with two meanings:

1. Someone who seeks to perform _systematically correct reasoning_, forming accurate world-models and using them to formulate successful plans that achieve goals.

2. A member of an amorphous social grouping centered around a [couple](https://www.lesswrong.com/) [websites](https://slatestarcodex.com/), with a physical concentration in Berkeley, California, with its own jargon, in-jokes, and social hierarchies; special cultural emphases on polyamory, giving money or working for "Effective Altruist"-branded nonprofit organizations, concern about a theorized [intelligence explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosion); _&c_.

I've found that the conflation of rationalist₁ (systematically correct reasoners) and rationalist₂ (member of a particular Berkeley robot cult) has been a _huge_ stumbling block in my own thinking. To be sure, words can have more than one definition and can be used in many ways: if _you_, dear reader, don't have a problem mentally distinguishing between rationalist₁ and rationalist₂ from context (for example, the phrase "aspiring rationalist" suggests that rationalist₁ is meant), that's great! I don't think _I've_ been that skillful, though.

(Notice how when I say "We have this word", I'm using the first-person _we_ to talk about the rationalists₂? I'm not talking about talking about [the likes of René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism).)
