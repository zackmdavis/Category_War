## Making It Personal

You come to me and say, "What's with this obsessive, multi-year blogging campaign advocating an inadvisably-extreme position in the philosophy of language? I'm afraid you're mistakenâ€”we get to define our words _however the hell we like_."

I reply: [you're lying](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sXHQ9R5tahiaXEZhR/algorithmic-intent-a-hansonian-generalized-anti-zombie). You don't actually believe that. No one actually believes that when they have [Something to Protect](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SGR4GxFK7KmW7ckCB/something-to-protect).

I want you to imagine there is a man who hates you. Not for any reason you can discern.

Call him Eugene N.


"[Your name here] is a white supremacist!" "[Your name here] molests children!" "[Your name here] murdered my daughter!"


And that is why I blog about the philosophy of language.
