In ["Against Lie Inflation"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/16/against-lie-inflation/), the immortal Scott Alexander argues that the word "lie" should be reserved for knowingly-made false statements, and not used in an expanded sense that includes unconscious motivated reasoning.




As [Ben Hoffman points out in the comments](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/16/against-lie-inflation/#comment-777559), 


> Politicians lie, but not _too much_. Take the top story on Politifact Fact Check today. Some Republican claimed his supposedly-maverick Democratic opponent actually voted with Obama's economic policies 97 percent of the time. Fact Check explains that the statistic used was actually for all votes, not just economic votes, and that members of Congress typically have to have >90% agreement with their president because of the way partisan politics work. **So it's a lie, and is properly listed as one.** But it's a lie based on slightly misinterpreting a real statistic. He didn't just totally make up a number. He didn’t even just make up something else, like "My opponent personally helped design most of Obama's legislation". [bolding mine —ZMD]

> [P]eople think in terms of categories with central and noncentral members–a sparrow is a central bird, an ostrich a noncentral one. But if you live on the Ostrich World, which is inhabited only by ostriches, emus, and cassowaries, then probably an ostrich seems like a pretty central example of 'bird' and the first sparrow you see will be fantastically strange.

What if we live in Ostrich World? I mean—what if unconscious lying is the central case?
