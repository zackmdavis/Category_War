"You'll Never Persuade Anyone Like That"

Wilhelmâ€”
> "you are starting to persuade me, or you might be persuade others, and I don't want you to do that because I am in cognitive dissonance or have pre-existing commitments that are counter to your perspective"

> if A is talking to B, and then B starts telling A what he needs to do to be more persuasive to C, this is logical rudeness, unless A accepts the premise that the goal is to persuade C

> what's really going on in the ABC scenario is that B is uncomfortable with A's claims due to cognitive dissonance, but doesn't have an immediate rebuttal to provide, so he launders his discomfort by saying that C would not be persuaded

non-truthseeking conversation as a negotiation
move the locus of negotiation elsewhere

angelic irony response: persuasion is anti-social
straightforward response: this post


 I'm trying to say what I actually think and feel in clear language! Whether other people are persuaded by this is their business, not mine!
