I'm _not_ talking about the problem of pressure on your beliefs

For example, if you said you've never stepped foot in Albuquerque, everyone would agree that this would be falsified by a (non-doctored) photo of you in Albuquerque, because "never stepped foot in" doesn't leave very much linguistic wiggle room.

But if you said you were "Fine" when I asked how you were, and actually you were a little bit sad, one could argue that it's not [...]


When's the last time you had motives to optimize your communication for having some affect on people other than causing them to have more accurate anticipations of experience? _Every fucking time you open your mouth_, that's when.

Suppose I see someone wearing a red shirt stealing from the cookie jar. Carol often wears red [maybe not the best example]

I will grant that not-lying has the advantage of being a bright line rather than a messy border

Bayesian 

on the other hand, you don't want to be exploitable by motivated misunderstandings

a topical example: OpenAI's Rubik's cube, Greg Brockman

Katja Grace on "principles are for bargaining"

disambiguate what I'm saying from "If we can't lie to others, we will lie to ourselves"

by "God" I just mean the order and beauty in the universe

Ostrich World

This view is making some implicit assumptions about human psychology: 


As [Ben Hoffman points out in the comments](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/16/against-lie-inflation/#comment-777559), 


> Politicians lie, but not _too much_. Take the top story on Politifact Fact Check today. Some Republican claimed his supposedly-maverick Democratic opponent actually voted with Obama's economic policies 97 percent of the time. Fact Check explains that the statistic used was actually for all votes, not just economic votes, and that members of Congress typically have to have >90% agreement with their president because of the way partisan politics work. **So it's a lie, and is properly listed as one.** But it's a lie based on slightly misinterpreting a real statistic. He didn't just totally make up a number. He didn't even just make up something else, like "My opponent personally helped design most of Obama's legislation". [bolding mine —ZMD]

> [P]eople think in terms of categories with central and noncentral members–a sparrow is a central bird, an ostrich a noncentral one. But if you live on the Ostrich World, which is inhabited only by ostriches, emus, and cassowaries, then probably an ostrich seems like a pretty central example of 'bird' and the first sparrow you see will be fantastically strange.

What if we live in Ostrich World? I mean—what if unconscious lying is the central case?

> Suppose I were to invent a new word, "zaxlebax," and define it as "a metallic sphere, like the Washington Monument." That's the definition—"a metallic sphere, like the Washington Monument." In short, I build my ill-chosen example into the definition. Now some linguistic subgroup might start using the term "zaxlebax" as though it just meant "metallic sphere," or as though it just meant "something of the same kind as the Washington Monument." And that's fine. But my definition incorporates both, and thus conceals the false assumption that the Washington Monument is a metallic sphere; any attempt to use the term "zaxlebax," meaning what I mean by it, involves the user in this false assumption.

DRAFT: "Maybe Lying Doesn't Exist"

Attention conservation notice: this is _not_ a "privileged" meeting of the Blight-alarmist coordination group (if that's a thing); this is just me personally sending _my_ blog post draft to a few people who I still happen to have outgoing-mail privileges with, for them to _probably_ ignore as they see fit.

Scott is too famous and too traumatized to do any real thinking these days, but the audience might learn something?

Writing the "Appeals to Consequences Are Invalid" section made me feel less angry at Scott over our earlier dispute, because I'm now leaning towards the hypothesis that he's _not_ opporunistically switching philosophy stances because throwing me under the bus helped him stay out of [Overton debt](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DoPo4PDjgSySquHX8/heads-i-win-tails-never-heard-of-her-or-selective-reporting)! He _actually doesn't get it_. He's _actually that dumb!_ (Trauma-induced dumb, not _g_-factor dumb.)

Hopefully the second section helps clarify the state of my persistent disagreement with the other Blight-alarmists on the lie/scam/fraud issue??

I originally went for "Appeals to Consequences Are Insane", but I'm going with "Invalid" as a strategic concession to the target audience, who will write me off as too "mean" if I say _insane_ in the section title. (One use of _insane_ survives in the text.)

Is it bad (is it lying??) if the title is kind of clickbaity? (Outrageous four-word summary incentivizes a click, but then the actual post is less outrageous.) Not sure what else I would call it.

Like that dog she had heard about, she thought ... somebody's dog in somebody's laboratory ... the dog who got his signals switched on him, and saw no way to tell satisfaction from torture, saw food changed to beatings and beatings to food, saw his eyes and ears deceiving him and his judgement futile and his consciousness impotent in a shifting, swimming, shapeless world—and gave up, refusing to eat at that price or live in a world of that kind. No!—was the only conscious word in her brain—no!—no!—no!—not your way, not your world—even if this "no" is all that's to be left of mine!
