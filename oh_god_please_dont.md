# Contra Scott Alexander on Mental Illness; Or, Oh God, Please Don't Send Me Back to The Hospital, Oh God, I'll be Good From Now On, I Swear

Reading the debate between economist Bryan Caplan and the immortal Scott Alexander on psychiatry and the ontological status of mental illness, I find myself torn.

[TODO: one-sentence summary of positions]

While I have a friendly[^friendly] [ongoing dispute](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bSmgPNS6MTJsunTzS/maybe-lying-doesn-t-exist#6RY85nrkD28kodryK) with Alexander about [the cognitive function of categories](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/esRZaPXSHgWzyB2NL/where-to-draw-the-boundaries), I must say that Alexander is _much less_ confused than Caplan about the relevant philosophy. (Seriously. Caplan believes in [nodeterministic free will](http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/freewill). [_Lame._](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FqJGfSrXphrcwpiZe/causality-and-moral-responsibility))

[^friendly]: Well, friendly on Scott's side, anyway. My side of the conversation tends to involve more yelling, crying, cussing, and begging. It's okay if you think less of my character because of thisâ€”as long as your character assessments of _people_ making philosophy arguments, doesn't interfere with your ability to assess the correctness of the arguments themselves.

And connotationally, Alexander seems sympathetic to crazy people, whereas Caplan seems broadly unsympathetic. Here again I find myself siding with Alexander and against Caplan.

And yet, _speaking as a crazy person_, I find that I feel _much safer_ around people who take Caplan's view (mental illness is fake) rather than people who take Alexander's view (mental illness is a useful construct). It seems worth trying to explain why.

I think it might have something to do with how the people who believe in mental illness keep _sending armed men to kidnap me, throw me in a secret jail, and charging me hundreds or thousands of dollars for it, all while piously _.

 The following balances are what was left after insurance kicked in:
The Fremont Hospital was about $250.
The transport bill was the big one $669. 
Which is a lot less than the thousands they originally billed.   
The reason I am paying promptly is because I don't want this to af
