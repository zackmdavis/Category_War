# Contra Scott Alexander on Mental Illness; Or, Oh God, Please Don't Send Me Back to The Hospital, Oh God, I'll be Good From Now On, I Swear

Reading the debate between economist Bryan Caplan and the immortal Scott Alexander on psychiatry and the ontological status of mental illness, I find myself torn.

[TODO: one-sentence summary of positions]

While I have a friendly[^friendly] [ongoing dispute]() with Alexander about [the cognitive function of categories](), I must say that Alexander is much _less_ confused than Caplan about the relevant philosophy. (Seriously. Caplan believes in [nodeterministic free will](http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/freewill). [_Lame._](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FqJGfSrXphrcwpiZe/causality-and-moral-responsibility))

[^friendly]: Well, friendly on Scott's side, anyway. My side of the conversation tends to involve more yelling, crying, cussing, and begging.

Also, connotationally, Alexander seems sympathetic to crazy people, whereas Caplan seems broadly unsympathetic. Again I find myself siding with Alexander.

And yet, _speaking as a crazy person_, I find that I feel _much safer_ around people who take Caplan's view rather than people who take Alexander's view.

I think it has something to do with how the people who believe in mental illness keep _sending armed men to kidnap me and throw me in a secret jail, and charging me hundreds or thousands of dollars for it, all while piously _.

In other words, [blatant authoritarianism is the best kind!](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KzAG4yWQJosmEjHe2/blatant-lies-are-the-best-kind)


 The following balances are what was left after insurance kicked in:
The Fremont Hospital was about $250.
The transport bill was the big one $669. 
Which is a lot less than the thousands they originally billed.   
The reason I am paying promptly is because I don't want this to af

antipsychotics, judgy language, and the rationalist civil war

_(Attention conservation notice: I "should" be writing blog posts (published to everyone who enjoys reading me) rather than this email (implicitly bidding for scarce Scott-bandwidth in particular), but somehow this feels more motivating.)_

Incidentally, Jessica has been claiming that you said that people who have ever had a single psychotic break should be on antipsychotics for life. Thought I'd check—is that really your position, or did Jessica somehow mishear[^lying] what you actually said?

[^lying]: I was tempted to say "is Jessica lying about what you actually said", on the grounds that _Jessica_ has no grounds to complain about [inflated](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/16/against-lie-inflation/) "lying" accusations, but let's go with the charitable version.

I had thought that I shouldn't email you about this on account of feeling like I blew at _least_ nine month's worth of my rationed supply of Scott-bandwidth on Newtonmas (thanks again!), but I was thinking[^thinking] of writing up my thoughts on your debate with Bryan Caplan (working title: "Contra Scott Alexander on Mental Illness; Or, Oh God, Please Don't Send Me Back to the Hospital, Oh God, I'll be Good From Now On, I Swear"), and this might be relevant background context to both that, and to de-escalating the rationalist civil war.[^war]

[^thinking]: 

[^war]: _You_ think we obviously shouldn't have a war, but the Unionists/Loyalists always think that!

Even without any domain expertise, the "one psychotic break → drugged for life" position seems _obviously_ bonkers in _my_ case, where both of my 5150 events were triggered by losing a night of sleep. _After getting sleep_ (and time to process the trauma of ), I went back to being my normal self.
