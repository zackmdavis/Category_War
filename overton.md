> overton-window fights

So, sorry in advance if I'm reading too much into a casual choice of words, but—this is an _incredibly ominous_ metaphor, right? To be _very_ clear: I've _also_ indpendently used this metaphor recently, so I'm not criticizing _you_—I'm expressing frustration with the _background state of affairs_ that make multiple people independently find the "Overton window" frame apt without immediately noticing how _incredibly ominous_ it is. (I didn't notice, at first.)

Maybe my [rationality realism](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality) is showing, but I thought the premise and promise of the website is that there are [_laws_ of systematically correct reasoning](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eY45uCCX7DdwJ4Jha/no-one-can-exempt-you-from-rationality-s-laws) as objective as mathematics—different mathematicians from different cultures might have different _interests_ (like analysis or algebra) or be accustomed to different _notations_, but ultimately, they're all on the same cooperative quest for Truth—even if that cooperative _process_ may occasionally involve some amount of yelling and crying.

[("And being universals," said the Lady 3rd, "they bear no distinguishing evidence of their origin.")](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qCsxiojX7BSLuuBgQ/the-super-happy-people-3-8)

The [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) concept describes a process of _social-pressure mind control_: an idea is said to be "outside the Overton window" not on account of its being _wrong_, but on account of its being unacceptably _unpopular_. If a mathematician were to describe a debate with their colleagues _about mathematics_ (as opposed to some dumb non-math thing like tenure or teaching duties) as an "Overton-window fight", I would be _kind of worried_ about the culture of that mathematics department, wouldn't you?! (Again—I have to repeat it because no one believes you when you only say it once—worried about the _culture_. Obviously _not_ trying to cast out individual mathematicians as heretics on account of one ominous metaphor choice. Because that would be _retarded_.)

Seven years ago, [I thought I discovered a potentially interesting math concept](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2012/10/introducing-the-fractional-arithmetic-derivative/). I had read about two different infrequently-used generalizations of the idea of a "derivative": the [fractional derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_calculus) and the [arithmetic derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_derivative), and so I thought, hey, why not combine these ideas and have a fractional arithmetic derivative? You can think of the arithmetic derivative as applying a "formal" (symbol-manipulation, not worrying about interpretation) version of the [power rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_rule) to the prime factorization of an integer. An expression for the [iterated power rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_derivative#Second_derivative_power_rule) ends up involving factorials—so if we just swap in the gamma function (our standard generalization of the factorial to non-integers), and we should be able to take non-integer fractional derivatives, right? I was _very_ proud of myself and told [Alex Mennen](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/alexmennen) at that week's _Less Wrong_ meetup at the [Free Speech Café](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/about/fsm-cafe).

Turns out, my idea was _garbage_. And I think it's important to say it like that, that my idea was _garbage_—not that I 

(Alex Mennen would have surely caught it if he had actually tried to check. Maybe I should have offered review prize money.)


> concepts that multiple longterm community members actually want to make bids for community attention/endorsement of

Again, sorry in advance if I'm reading too much into a casual choice of words, but—paying attention to what "longterm community members" want is an instance of [Goodhart's law](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YtvZxRpZjcFNwJecS/the-importance-of-goodhart-s-law). (Some would say of the [regressional](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy) variety, but I think [this case is actually adversarial](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZSkForf7e5nEKGDdb/goodhart-taxonomy-agreement#Adversarial).) We _want_ concepts that advance the art of human rationality! The _hope_ is that
