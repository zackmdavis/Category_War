Heads, I Win; Tails?—Never Heard of Her

Instrumental Addition: (building an artificial arithmatician, it gets PlusOf(Six, Seven) == Fourteen; trying to object that it's actually Thirteen is met with "But thirteen is an unlucky number" "You don't believe that" "No, but the Public does—if our Artificial Arithmatifcian shoving 13s in people's faces, that looks bad. It wouldn't be instrumentally rational" "If you're doing systematically correct artithmetic, you should get the right answer even on questions that don't matter. Our marketing literature says. Doesn't that make us a scam?" "How dare you?" "I wish I had better terminology for this to differentiate the thing I'm trying to point at, from _actual_ scammers. ...

"We have a partnership with the Rare Disease in Cute Puppies—our logos are on each other's websites. Stuff that looks bad for us, also looks bad for _them_, which is bad for the puppies."
"But ... if they're actually _using_ our product, won't they need it to give correct results?"

"Get out of my office"

You fantasize about resigning, or whistleblowing, but that's impossible. It's not you—it's the incentives.

Whether "substitute meat is meat" should depend on the _quality of the substitute_ (even meat-eaters will agree to this part), not how many animals are suffering (meat eaters would consider this fraud)

the judge has to treat the fake meat/fool's gold cases similarly (even if the gold seller is giving to AI risk)

As it is written—

_The third virtue is lightness!_ To make a true map of a city you _must_ walk through the city and draw lines on paper that correspond to what you see. If, seeing the city unclearly, you think that you can shift a line just a little to the right, just a little to the left, according to your caprice—or _in order to save a life_—this is just the same mistake.

_The ninth virtue is perfectionism!_ The more errors you correct in yourself, the more you notice. If you tolerate an error rather than correcting it—even _to save a life_—you will not gain the skill to notice new errors. Do not be content with the answer that is almost right; seek one that is exactly right.

_The tenth virtue is precision!_ Each piece of evidence shifts your beliefs by exactly the right amount, neither more nor less. Even if you cannot do the math, knowing that the math exists tells you that the dance step is precise and has no room in it for your whims—and no room in it _to save a life_.

And if you speak overmuch of the Way you will not attain it.
