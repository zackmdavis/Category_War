Wait, really?? Do I _really_ need to explain this? On _this_ website?

"Yes!"

Jesus Christ. Wake me up when [September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) ends ... _fine_. Fine!

Whether "substitute meat is meat" should depend on the _quality of the substitute_ (even meat-eaters will agree to this part), not how many animals are suffering (meat eaters would consider this fraud)

the judge has to treat the fake meat/fool's gold cases similarly (even if the gold seller is giving to AI risk)

animal rights activists celebrate a victory, buys gold watch—if you wanted Au gold

As it is written—

_The third virtue is lightness!_ To make a true map of a city you _must_ walk through the city and draw lines on paper that correspond to what you see. If, seeing the city unclearly, you think that you can shift a line just a little to the right, just a little to the left, according to your caprice—or _in order to save a life_—this is just the same mistake.

_The ninth virtue is perfectionism!_ The more errors you correct in yourself, the more you notice. If you tolerate an error rather than correcting it—even _to save a life_—you will not gain the skill to notice new errors. Do not be content with the answer that is almost right; seek one that is exactly right.

_The tenth virtue is precision!_ Each piece of evidence shifts your beliefs by exactly the right amount, neither more nor less. Even if you cannot do the math, knowing that the math exists tells you that the dance step is precise and has no room in it for your whims—and no room in it _to save a life_.

And if you speak overmuch of the Way you will not attain it.
