> _Dot by dot, building up the image  
> Shot by shot, keeping at a distance doesn't pay  
> Still if you remember your objective  
> Not give all your privacy away  
> A little bit of hype can be effective  
> Long as you can keep it in perspective  
> After all without some recognition  
> No one's going to give you a commission  
> Which will cause a crack in your foundation  
> You'll have wasted all of that conversation!_
