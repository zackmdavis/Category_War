# Speech Is Thought

The function of speech is to communicate information! Information about the structure of reality! Reality is very complicated, so I'm grateful to have _language_ with [expressive vocabulary](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/H7Rs8HqrwBDque8Ru/expressive-vocabulary) and generative recursive grammar with which to encode the structure I have in my head!

Sometimes people come to me and say, " then you will be [the one who is blameworthy](http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/blame-games/)."


Cosmides and Tooby [relate a parable about](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Evolution-of-War-and-its-Cognitive-Foundations-Tooby-Cosmides/28c03bb35f9eaf6621c0e0346adaa4a7d93067d5) a man with a gun.
