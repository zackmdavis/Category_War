Let Well a-Tone; Or, The Instrumental Rationalist's Gambit Declined

**DRAMATIS PERSONÆ**

_**Pat**, a rationalist who lives in Berkeley, California. 98th percentile verbal intelligence. Enjoys Markovian opera, and pogs. Probably a good coalition member._

_**Carrie**, some crazy bitch who, foolishly, also lives in Berkeley, California. 97th percentile verbal intelligence. Just barely plausibly a.f.a.b. Probably not a good coalition member._

**Pat**: I think you'd be better at persuading people if you changed your tone.

**Carrie**: Thanks for the marketing advice! I should _definitely_ take that into account if I ever decide to put more effort into 'persuading people', which sounds like something that an aspiring instrumental rationalist would care about. Perhaps unfortunately, however, I'm an aspiring epistemic rationalist: all I can do is try to communicate what I actually think and feel using clear language (and standard rhetorical techniques like sarcasm, satire, _&c_. that people know how to interpret even if they wouldn't be clear if someone naïvely took the words literally). If other people aren't persuaded by this ... maybe they _shouldn't_ be! _Maybe_ I can live with that.

Ozy's reply—

I don't believe you. Unless you are talking because you enjoy the physical action of typing, you are talking to *communicate*. The aspiring epistemic rationalist can, after all, sit by himself and think without typing anything. Presumably you are engaged in some sort of collaborative truthseeking. I can imagine circumstances in which your primary goal in collaborative truthseeking is not to help people find those bits of truth with you possess: for instance, your goal could be to seek criticism of your ideas from others. In that case, making your critics not want to interact with you seems like a poor way of achieving your goal. 

(I expect you are actually behaving neither like an aspiring instrumental rationalist nor like an aspiring epistemic rationalist, but instead like an actual FUCK YOU YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD (slams door). Which is fine, it's a stage you have to work through, and I hope at some point you will be able to join in collaborative truthseeking again.)

Ruby's reply—

As you say in your next paragraph, one should be careful before asserting someone is obviously wrong. But sometimes they are. But if the goal is everyone being less wrong, I think some means of communicating are going to be more effective than others. I, at least, am a social monkey. If I am bluntly told I am wrong (even if I agree, even in private—but especially in public), I will feel attacked (if only at the S1 level), threatened (socially), and become defensive. It makes it hard to update and it makes it easy to dislike the one who called me out. The harsh calling out might be effective for onlookers, I suppose. But the strength of the “wrongness assertion” really should come from the arguments behind it, not the rhetoric force of the speaker. If the arguments are solid, it should be damning even with a gentle tone. If people ought to update that my reasoning is poor, they can do so even if the speaker was being polite and according respect.

Even if you wish to express that someone is wrong, I think this is done more effectively if one simultaneously continues to implicitly express “I think there is still some prior that you are correct and I curious to hear your thoughts”, or failing that “You are very clearly wrong here yet I still respect you as a thinker who is worth my time to discourse with.” If neither of those is true, you’re in a tough position. Maybe you want them to go away, or you just want other people not believe false things. There’s an icky thing here I feel like for there to be productive and healthy discussion you have to act as though at least one of the above statements is true, even if it isn’t. No one is going to respond well to discussion with someone who they think doesn’t respect them and is happy to broadcast that judgment to everyone else (doing so is legitimately quite a hostile social move).

The hard thing is here is that’s about perceptions more than intentions. People interpreting things differently, people have different fears and anxieties, and that means things can come across as more hostile than they’re intended. Or the receiver judges is more afraid about others will think than the speaker (reasonably—the receiver has more at stake).

Though around here, people are pretty good at admitting they’re wrong. But I think certain factors about how they’re communicated with can determine whether it feels like a helpful correction vs a personal attack.

    More generally, I’m in favor of politeness norms where politeness doesn’t sacrifice expressive power, 

This might be because I’m overly confident in my writing ability, but I don’t think maintaining politeness would ever curtail my expressive power, although admittedly it can take a lot more time. Do you have any examples, real or fictional, where you feel expressiveness was sacrificed to politeness?

    but I’m wary of excessive emphasis on collaborative norms (what some authors would call “tone-policing”) being used to obfuscate information exchange or even shut it down

At the risk of sparking controversy, can you link to any examples of this on LessWrong from the past few years? I want to know if we’re actually at in danger of this at all.

    (what some authors would call “tone-policing”) being used to obfuscate information exchange or even shut it down (via what Yudkowsky characterized as appeal-to-egalitarianism conversation-halters).

I think the tough thing is that all norms can be weaponized and abused. Basically, if you have a goal which isn’t truth-seeking (which we all do), then there is no norm I can imagine which on its own will stop you. The absence of tone-policing permits heated angry exchanges, attacks, and bullying—but so does a tone policing which is selectively enforced.

On LessWrong, I think we need to strike a balance. We should never say “you used a mean tone, therefore you are wrong and must immediately leave the discussion” or “all opinions must be given equal respect” (cue your link); but we should still say “no, you can’t call people idiots here” and “if you’re going to argue with someone, this can go a lot better if you’re open to the fact that you could be the wrong one.”

Naturally, there’s a lot of grey area in the middle. I like the idea of us being a community where we discuss what ideal discussion looks like, continually refining our norms to something that works really well.

(Hence my writing all this at length—trying to get my own thoughts in order and have something to refer back to/later compile into a post.)
