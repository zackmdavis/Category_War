### Unnatural Categories Are Optimized for Deception

_There is an important difference between having a utility function defined over a statistical model's performance against specific real-world data (even if another mind with different values would be interested in different data), and having a utility function defined over features of the model itself._

_Arbitrariness in the map doesn't correspond to arbitrariness in the territory. Whatever criterion your brain is using to decide which word you want,_ is _your non-arbitrary reason ..._

So the one comes back to you and says:

> That seems wrong—why wouldn't I care about the utility of having a particular model? I agree that categories derive much of their usefulness from "carving reality at the joints"—that's _one_ very important kind of consequence of choosing to draw category boundaries in a particular way. But I don't see why I shouldn't be willing to trade off one unit of categorizational nonawkwardness (not even one unit of epistemology, I feel like my epistemology will let me make exactly as good predictions as yours will about any [...] in the vicinity) for X units of morality, even if (as I think we both agree) trading off one million units of categorizational nonawkwardness for the same X units of morality would be bad.

> I think of language, following Eliezer's definitions sequence, as being a human-made project intended to help people understand each other. It draws on the structure of reality, but has many free variables, so that the structure of reality doesn't constrain it completely. This forces us to make decisions, and since these are not about factual states of the world (eg what the definition of "lie" REALLY is, in God's dictionary) we have nothing to make those decisions on except consequences.

> You _can_ define a word any way you want, you just have to pay the costs

Okay, I think I see the problem. I can see one might have gotten that out of ["A Human's Guide to Words"](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb) _if you skipped all the parts with math_. I am now prepared to explain _exactly_ what's wrong here in _more detail_ than [my previous attempt](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/esRZaPXSHgWzyB2NL/where-to-draw-the-boundaries): not just _that_ this position is not in harmony with the hidden Bayesian structure of language and cognition, but how the hidden Bayesian structure of language and cognition explains _why_ an intelligent system might find this particular mistake tempting in the first place.

Category "boundaries" are a useful _visual metaphor_ for helping explain the cognitive function of categorization. If you understand the visualization but you _don't_ understand the math, you might think you have the freedom to "redraw" the category "boundaries". Simple, compact boundaries might _tend_ to be more useful, but
