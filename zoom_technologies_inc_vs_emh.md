# Zoom Technologies, Inc. vs. the Efficient Markets Hypothesis

The efficient markets hypothesis is the idea ["that asset prices reflect all available information"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) (or _EMH_ for short). Price changes in a liquid market are understood to be unpredictable—[_anti_-inductive](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h24JGbmweNpWZfBkM/markets-are-anti-inductive). Suppose some stock has the [ticker symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_symbol) LW. If you want to buy a hundred shares of LW at $10 per share because you think their price is going to go way up, you need to buy them _from_ someone who's willing to _sell_ at that price—who presumably does _not_ agree that the price is going to go way up. If people _know_ that a share of LW is "really" worth $20 even though the current price is $10, then they should expect to profit by continuing to buy shares from anyone willing to sell them for less than $20, until the market price really is $20. In this way, [the market construed as an intelligent system](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/brhWPoNsBN7za3xjs/competitive-markets-as-distributed-backprop) aggregates and processes the information implied by traders' behavior in accordance with the [fourth virtue of evenness](http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/): "if you knew your destination, you would already be there."

What does it mean for a share of LW to "really" be worth $20? According to the [subjective theory of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value), there isn't really a fact of the matter over and above what people are willing to pay for it, but we expect there to be some sort of correspondence between the subjective economic value of a thing, and objective facts about the thing in the real physical universe. If I pay $3 for an iced-coffee, it would be circular to say that this is _simply because_ I value an iced-coffee at $3—that doesn't explain anything! Rather, I paid _because_ I expected to enjoy the experience of drinking it, the psychoactive effects of the caffiene, _&c._, and these actual properties of the coffee were worth more to me than a marginal $3.

The same goes for a share of LW, albeit at a somewhat higher level of abstraction. A fractional "share" of ownership in a business endeavor is valuable not _just because_ we circularly value it, but because the business produces things that are valued (like iced-coffees), and a share of ownership entitles one to a share of that value, in the form of dividend payments, or a claim on the business's assets should it fold, _&c._

This coupling between asset prices and the real world is why the "You shouldn't be able to predict price changes, because predictable price changes correspond to a profit opportunity that many agents are already trying to exploit" argument is taken to mean that market prices embody useful information about the world—the "randomness" of unpredictable market movements is that of _not knowing_ future information that hasn't already been taken into account, rather than the randomness of a pure [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk), unpredictable but ultimately signifying nothing.

That's why we have conversations like one on 16 February, when Robin Hanson said, ["In few months, China is likely to be a basket case, having crashed their economy in failed attempt to stop COVID-19 spreading"](https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/1229209586336489472), and Eliezer Yudkowsky replied, ["It seems to me like the markets don't look like they believe this."](https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1229529150098046976)

The efficient markets hypothesis is what makes "It looks like the markets don't believe this" seem like a germane reply. In contrast, if someone were to reply, "I asked my friend Kevin, and he doesn't believe it," that would prompt the obvious question, "Who is Kevin, and why should I care what he thinks about China's economy?" If one's answer to that question were, "Kevin is a smart guy and I trust him a lot", that would seem much less compelling than "If China was likely to be a basket case in a few months, then you would expect Chinese asserts to be priced lower by this competitive market of _lots_ of smart guys who I don't need to personally trust because the ones who are wrong will lose money; what do you know that _none_ of them do?"

Now I am but a humble autodidact programmer, not at all learned in the science of economics. But ... this is nuts, right? 

As it is written: "If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"

On the other hand, sometimes, the answer to that question is, "I am." Wei Dai thought traders were failing to react to the unprecedentedly grim consequences of the novel coronavirus and bought some [put options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option) (the right to sell a stock at a given price at a given future time) to bet that the market would go down, and quickly made 8x returns.



"implying that as of 2/10/2020 the market thought there was less than 1/8 chance things would be as bad as they are today. At least for me this puts a final nail in the coffin of EMH."
